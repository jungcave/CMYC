AI Overview
MobX stores are typically implemented as classes, but they can also be function objects. When using a function object as a store, you need to manage the observable properties and actions carefully.
Creating a Function Object Store
To create a function object store, you can use the observable function from MobX to wrap the object. This makes its properties observable.

import { observable, action } from 'mobx';

const createStore = () => {
  const store = observable({
    count: 0,
    increment: action(function() {
      this.count++;
    }),
    decrement: action(function() {
      this.count--;
    })
  });
  return store;
}

export default createStore;

Accessing and Modifying Properties
You can access and modify observable properties directly. When a property is changed, MobX will automatically update any components that are observing it.

import React from 'react';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react-lite';
import createStore from './store';

const App = observer(() => {
const store = createStore();

return (
<div>
<h1>Count: {store.count}</h1>
<button onClick={store.increment}>Increment</button>
<button onClick={store.decrement}>Decrement</button>
</div>
);
});

export default App;

Important Considerations
Actions:
When modifying observable properties, it's best practice to wrap the modifying function in an action to ensure MobX can track changes correctly.
this Context:
When using methods in a function object store, remember that this refers to the observable object itself, not the component or function.
Reactivity:
MobX tracks which observables are accessed during rendering and only re-renders components when those observables change.
Single Instance:
When using function object stores, make sure that you are using the same instance across components, otherwise each component will have its own isolated state.
By using a function object as a store, you can gain flexibility, but it's crucial to handle reactivity and actions correctly.
